## Variable Anchor contract  

The **Variable Anchor** is a variable-denominated shielded pool system  
derived from *Tornado Nova (tornado-pool)*. This system extends the shielded   
pool system into a bridged system and allows for join/split transactions.  
The system is built on top the **Anchor/LinkableTree** system which allows  
it to be linked to other **VAnchor** contracts through a simple graph-like  
interface where anchors maintain edges of their neighboring anchors.  
The system requires users to create and deposit UTXOs for the supported CW20  
asset into the smart contract and insert a commitment into the underlying  
merkle tree of the form:   
```
commitment = Poseidon(chainID, amount, pubKey, blinding)  
```  

The hash input is the UTXO data. All deposits/withdrawals are unified under  
a common `transact` function which requires a zkSNARK proof that the UTXO commitments  
are well-formed (i.e. that the deposit amount matches the sum of new UTXOs' amounts).  

Information regarding the commitments:   
- **Poseidon** is a zkSNARK friendly hash function  
- **destinationChainID** is the chainId of the destination chain, where the withdrawal  
    is intended to be made  
- Details of the UTXO and hashes are below  
*UTXO* = { destinationChainID, amount, pubkey, blinding }  
*commitment* = Poseidon(destinationChainID, amount, pubKey, blinding)  
*nullifier* = Poseidon(commitment, merklePath, sign(privKey, commitment, merklePath))  
Commitments adhering to different hash functions and formats will invalidate  
any attempt at withdrawal.  

Using the preimage / UTXO of the commitment, users can generate a zkSNARK proof that  
the UTXO is located in one-of-many **VAnchor merkle trees** and that the commitment's  
*destination chain id* matches the underlying chain id of the **VAnchor** where the  
transaction is taking place. The chain id opcode is leveraged to prevent any  
tampering of this data.  

## What's special in cosmwasm-vanchor  

Normally, all deposits/withdrawals are unified under a common `transact` function in `vanchor` contract.  
However, `cosmwasm-vanchor` introduces 2 entries: `transact-deposit(receive_cw20)` and `transact-withdraw`.   
  
In `cw20` token standard, if the user wants to trigger action on target contract with token transfer, she  
should use the `Send{contract, amount, msg}` message.  
The target contract should implement `Receive{sender, amount, msg}` message.
Naturally, these messages do not allow zero amount in their `amount` field from the obvious reasons.

`transact-deposit(receive_cw20)` function must be implemented using the `Send/Receive` mechanism,   
since it needs the `cw20` token transfer first & tx execution next.

But, `transact-withdraw` does not need to be using `Send/Receive` mechanism, since there is no `cw20`  
token transfer before tx execution. Also, if we use `Send/Receive` mechanism for `transact-withdraw`,  
it always runs into error, since `amount` is always zero.
