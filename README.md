## Introduction  
This repository contains the Cosmwasm implementation of **Webb Protocol**, which would be used for *Cosmos SDK* blockchains.   

## Contracts layout  
```
contracts/
    |___anchor/                    # Anchor(FixedDepositAnchor) contract
    |___anchor-handler/            # Contract for executing the creation & modification of anchor  
    |___mixer/                     # Mixer contract  
    |___signature-bridge/          # Contract for managing voting, resource, and maintainer composition through signature verification    
    |___tokenwrapper/              # Contract for wrapping pooled assets and minting pool share tokens  
    |___tokenwrapper-handler/      # Contract for executing the creation & modification of token-wrapper  
    |___vanchor/                   # Variable Anchor contract  
```  

## Building the contracts(wasm)

### Prerequisites
#### Install Rust & dependency
Install the latest version of Rust by following the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).  
Add the compilation target.
```
rustup default stable  
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Building
To build the contract, run the following command.
```
cargo wasm
```
You can see the output wasm file in the **target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release** directory.

For the optimization, run the following command.  
**Important**: You will need [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed to run this command.  
```
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/workspace-optimizer:0.12.5
```
Then, you can see the output wasm file in the **artifacts** directory.

## Testing 
Run the following command to run the unit tests.  
```
cargo test --release
```
